<p style="color:burlywood">I am a an Architecture student in my fourth year here at NJIT. I am very involved on campus and am a member of both a professional and a social fraternity.<br>
I have a multitude of hobbies that range from painting, drawing, skateboarding, playing with my cat, watching shows, etc. I am also a musician with over 14 years of experience on my instrument. <br>
Music is something that is a very important part of my life that I try to keep involved with every single day.</p>

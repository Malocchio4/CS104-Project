 <p>
    As an aspiring architect, I am motivated by a strong love for architecture and a lifelong interest in the construction industry. My father was a builder, and my stepmother was an outstanding architect when I was growing up. Their effect has been tremendous, which drove my passion for the art of designing environments that are both useful and visually beautiful. I was attracted to the interesting world of building and design from a young age, as I had the privilege to assist my stepmother, learning the technicalities of architectural work. This early exposure established a foundation for me to become an architect. I felt a sense of purpose and excitement while working on a building site or at an architect's office. What interests me the most about architecture is its ability to positively affect the world. Innovative architectural ideas, I believe, have the potential to reshape communities, making them more sustainable, functional, and visually appealing. I am determined to become a part of this process by producing ideas that serve a practical purpose but also enhance the way people feel.
